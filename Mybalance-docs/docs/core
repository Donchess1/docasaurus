This section describes the core concepts in the API.

`Customer`
A customer represents a user account (buyer/seller) on MyBalance which you must create if not already existing in order for a transaction to be initiated successfully.

`Transaction`
This is an escrow transaction which represents an arrangement where MyBalance holds and releases funds for a transaction once specified conditions are met.

`Settlement`
As the name implies, this represents payouts made to the merchant wallet once an escrow transaction has been completed and funds have been released.

`Dispute`
A dispute arises when there is a conflict between the buyer and seller, such as when the buyer decides to reject a delivered item or when seller does not receive funds in their wallet, necessitating resolution.
